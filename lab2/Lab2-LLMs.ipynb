    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this laboratory we will get our hands dirty working with Large Language Models (e.g. GPT and BERT) to do various useful things. I you haven't already, it is highly recommended to:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Read the [Attention is All you Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper, which is the basis for all transformer-based LLMs.\n",
    "+ Watch (and potentially *code along*) with this [Andrej Karpathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) which shows you how to build an autoregressive GPT model from the ground up.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 1: Warming Up\n",
    "In this first exercise you will train a *small* autoregressive GPT model for character generation (the one used by Karpathy in his video) to generate text in the style of Dante Aligheri. Use [this file](https://archive.org/stream/ladivinacommedia00997gut/1ddcd09.txt), which contains the entire text of Dante's Inferno (**note**: you will have to delete some introductory text at the top of the file before training). Train the model for a few epochs, monitor the loss, and generate some text at the end of training. Qualitatively evaluate the results"

    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "To feed these samples to a model, we need to find an efficient encoding of the sentences. \n",
    "Our preprocessing pipeline will be composed by two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sentence construction: we will build sentence pairs formed by `sent1` and the concatenation of `sent2` and each of the four possible continuations. This means that we will obtain four difference sentence pairs for each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tokenization: we will encode each sentence pair using the tokenizer provided by the model. Between the two sentences we will add a special token `[SEP]`, which is used by the model to distinguish between the two sentences. We will also have a special token `[CLS]` at the beginning of the first sentence, which contains the representation of the entire sentence pair. To build batches, we will pad each sample to the maximum length of the batch, adding the special token `[PAD]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡Lightning DataModules \n",
    "\n",
    "To keep code tidy and improve experiment repeatability, I used⚡Lightning's `LightningDataModule` to define the dataset, perform  preprocessing and the dataloaders. \n",
    "The `prepare_data` method is used to download the dataset and the Tokenizer, while the `setup` method is used to split the dataset into train, validation and test sets and perform preprocessing, tokenization and encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The processed dataset is composed by the following fields:\n",
    "- `input_ids`: tokenized and encoded text (context + question + options)\n",
    "- `attention_mask`: attention mask to avoid performing attention on padding tokens\n",
    "- `label`: index of the correct answer"

    "## Exercise 3.3: Training a Retrieval Model (hardest)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hugging Face dataset repository contains a large number of [\"text retrieval\" problems](https://huggingface.co/datasets?task_categories=task_categories:text-retrieval&p=1&sort=downloads). These tasks generally require that the model measure *similarity* between text in some metric space -- naively, just a cosine similarity between [CLS] tokens can get you pretty far. Find an interesting retrieval problem and train a model (starting from a pre-trained LLM of course) to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip**: Sometimes identifying the *retrieval* problems in these datasets can be half the challenge. [This dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BeIR/scifact) might be a good starting point.\n",
